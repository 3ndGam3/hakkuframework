µSploit Framework

µSploit framework is very basic exploit/peneration test tool framework.
Inspirited by websploit and metasploit. Websploits development has been sadly ended years ago so i decided to write my own.
I have been focused to make µSploit easy (user friendly) and simple to use as possible.
µSploit is written in python 3, and developed on ubuntu.

OS support:

Linux       supported, and developed on/for linux
OSX         isn't supported (yet), because i don't own mac
Windows     i think that windows will never get support from me, because mikkisofta sucks

Basic features:

-Run exploits
-Simple UI
-Includes scapy
-Easy to use
-Easy to write your own exploit (module)
-Scripting

available modules: 15
